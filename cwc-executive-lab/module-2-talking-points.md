## SLIDE 1: Title Slide
**Time: 1-2 minutes**

### Opening Script:
"Welcome to Module 2 of the Executive Leadership Lab. This month we're tackling something that trips up so many talented women of color—the gap between doing excellent work and actually being recognized for it.

Today's session is called **Strategic Positioning for Promotion**, and by the end, you'll have a concrete visibility plan and the tools to make sure your work doesn't go unnoticed."

### Engagement:
"Before we dive in, drop in the chat: On a scale of 1-10, how visible do you think your work is to decision-makers right now?"

---

## SLIDE 2: Welcome - Your Work Deserves Recognition
**Time: 2-3 minutes**

### Key Points:
- Acknowledge their hard work and results
- The stats are stark: 58% of WOC feel overlooked, 2x less likely to be promoted
- Today we're going to change that narrative

### Script:
"Look at these numbers. 58% of women of color report feeling overlooked for advancement. We're twice as likely to be passed over for promotion even when our performance is equal or better.

This isn't about working harder—you're already doing that. This is about working smarter with your visibility. Today, we fix that gap."

### Engagement:
"Raise your hand or put a '1' in chat if you've ever felt like your work went unnoticed while someone else got the credit."

---

## SLIDE 3: Objectives - What You'll Gain
**Time: 2 minutes**

### Key Points:
Walk through the four objectives:
1. **Create a Visibility Plan** - Strategic, tied to business outcomes
2. **Build a Win-Tracking System** - Your "receipts" for promotion conversations
3. **Master Performance Conversations** - Own check-ins and reviews
4. **Identify Your Sponsor Pipeline** - Know who needs to see your work

### Script:
"By the end of today, you'll walk away with four concrete deliverables. These aren't theoretical—you'll actually build these during our session together."

---

## SLIDE 4: The Challenge - Excellence Without Visibility
**Time: 3 minutes**

### Key Points:
Three archetypes that keep us stuck:
- **The Silent Achiever** - Great work, no one knows
- **The Untracked Wins** - Can't remember at review time
- **The Missing Advocates** - No one fighting for you in the room

### Script:
"Which of these sounds familiar? The Silent Achiever who delivers exceptional results but no one outside the immediate team knows their name? The one who can't remember their wins at review time? Or the one who realizes no one was advocating for them when the promotion decision was made?

Good work doesn't speak for itself. Good work needs a microphone. And today, we're going to give you that microphone."

### Engagement:
"In the chat, which of these three resonates most with where you are right now?"

---

## SLIDE 5: Framework - The Visibility Equation
**Time: 3-4 minutes**

### Key Points:
**Performance + Positioning + Promotion Criteria = Advancement**

Most high performers only focus on Performance. We need all three.

### Script:
"Here's the framework that changes everything. Advancement isn't just about what you do—it's about who knows what you do AND whether it aligns with what actually gets rewarded.

Most of us have been focused entirely on performance. We thought if we just worked hard enough, someone would notice. But that's only one-third of the equation.

Today we address all three parts."

### Pause Point:
"Take a moment—which of these three areas do you think is your biggest gap right now? Performance documentation? Positioning? Or understanding your promotion criteria?"

---

## SLIDE 6: Deep Dive - Know Your Promotion Criteria
**Time: 4 minutes**

### Key Points:
- You can't hit a target you can't see
- Signs you're missing this: guessing what leadership values, surprised by feedback
- The breakthrough: Research criteria, ask your manager, align your work

### Script:
"Let's start with promotion criteria. You cannot hit a target you cannot see.

How many of you actually know what your organization's documented promotion criteria are? Not what you assume they are—what's actually written down?

If you don't know what 'exceeds expectations' means at your company, if you're guessing what leadership values, if your goals don't align with documented competencies—you're playing a game without knowing the rules.

This week, I want you to find out. Ask your manager directly: 'What does promotable look like in the next cycle?' Get specific."

---

## SLIDE 7: Deep Dive - Strategic Visibility
**Time: 4 minutes**

### Key Points:
- Being seen by the RIGHT people, at the RIGHT time, for the RIGHT work
- Signs you're invisible: Not invited to strategic meetings, manager takes credit, opportunities go to less qualified peers
- The breakthrough: Identify decision-makers, find authentic channels, share consistently

### Script:
"Strategic visibility isn't about being loud or self-promotional in a way that feels inauthentic. It's about being intentional.

Who makes promotion decisions at your organization? Is it just your manager, or is there a calibration committee? Who's in that room when your name comes up?

If decision-makers don't know your name, if you're not invited to strategic conversations, if opportunities keep going to people who are less qualified but more visible—that's a visibility problem, not a performance problem."

---

## SLIDE 8: Deep Dive - Win Documentation
**Time: 3 minutes**

### Key Points:
- Your manager has dozens of reports—they can't remember everything
- You need "receipts"
- Document weekly, include metrics, save praise emails

### Script:
"Here's a truth bomb: Your manager has too many direct reports and too much on their plate to remember every good thing you've done. That's not their fault—it's just reality.

So when they go into that calibration meeting to advocate for your promotion, what evidence do they have? Only what you've given them.

If you're scrambling to write self-assessments, if you're forgetting accomplishments from Q1 by Q4—you're leaving your advancement to chance. We're going to fix that today."

---

## SLIDE 9: Quote Slide
**Time: 1 minute**

### Script:
"I want you to sit with this for a moment: 'Visibility isn't bragging. It's ensuring your contributions are known by those who make decisions about your future.'

This is a reframe many of us need. We've been taught that self-promotion is arrogant. But staying silent about your contributions isn't humble—it's a disservice to your career and to the organization that needs to know who their high performers are."

---

## SLIDE 10: Root Causes - Why Your Work Goes Unseen
**Time: 3-4 minutes**

### Key Points:
Six root causes:
1. Modesty culture
2. No tracking system
3. Wrong audience
4. Inconsistent communication
5. Fear of self-promotion
6. Waiting to be noticed

### Script:
"Let's get to the root of why this happens. These six patterns are incredibly common, especially for women of color:

**Modesty culture** - We were taught that talking about ourselves is inappropriate
**No tracking system** - Without a system, wins just disappear
**Wrong audience** - Your manager knows, but the people who make decisions don't
**Inconsistent communication** - You spike at review time but go silent the rest of the year
**Fear of self-promotion** - Worrying about being seen as 'too much'
**Waiting to be noticed** - Believing hard work will automatically be recognized

Which of these is your biggest barrier? Be honest with yourself."

---

## SLIDE 11: Activity - Visibility Diagnostic
**Time: 7-8 minutes**

### Facilitation:
"Now we're going to do a quick diagnostic. I'm giving you 5 minutes.

**Part 1:** List everyone who currently knows about your work and impact. How far does your visibility actually reach?

**Part 2:** Now identify the decision-makers and stakeholders who SHOULD know your work but don't. These are your visibility gaps.

I'll put you in breakout rooms of 3-4 people. Share what you discovered. You have 5 minutes—go!"

### Debrief:
"What did you discover? Anyone willing to share a gap they identified?"

---

## SLIDE 12: Framework - The Win-Tracking System
**Time: 4-5 minutes**

### Key Points:
**WHAT / SO WHAT / NOW WHAT framework**

### Script:
"Every win you document should answer three questions:

**WHAT** - What did you accomplish? Be specific.

**SO WHAT** - What was the business impact? This is where the metrics come in. Revenue, time saved, problems solved.

**NOW WHAT** - How does this connect to future goals or promotion criteria?

Let me give you examples..."

### Examples:
**Corporate:** "I led the Q1 product launch (WHAT), which generated $2M in new revenue and 15% customer growth (SO WHAT), positioning us to expand into enterprise sales—a key strategic priority (NOW WHAT)."

**Non-Profit:** "I redesigned our volunteer onboarding program (WHAT), increasing retention by 40% and reducing training time by 2 weeks (SO WHAT), enabling us to scale our community outreach initiative ahead of schedule (NOW WHAT)."

---

## SLIDE 13: Activity - Start Your Win Log
**Time: 12-15 minutes**

### Facilitation:
"Now it's your turn. Using the What / So What / Now What framework, I want you to capture 3-5 wins from the past 30 days.

I'm sharing the Win Tracking Template in the chat now. You have 10 minutes. Don't overthink it—just get the wins documented.

**Pro tip:** Set a weekly 5-minute calendar reminder to update this. Friday afternoons work well—you're wrapping up the week anyway."

## SLIDE 14: Visibility Strategy Checklist
**Time: 3 minutes**

### Key Points:
Walk through the six steps:
1. **Promotion Criteria** - Document what your org rewards
2. **Key Stakeholders** - Identify 3-5 decision-makers
3. **Communication Channels** - How will you reach them?
4. **Frequency** - How often will you share?
5. **Win Categories** - What types of wins to highlight
6. **Review Rhythm** - Monthly visibility check

### Script:
"This is your visibility playbook. Six steps that turn random visibility into strategic positioning. We're going to build this out together."

---

## SLIDE 15: Activity - Build Your Visibility Plan
**Time: 20-25 minutes**

### Facilitation:
"This is the deep work. I'm sharing the Visibility Strategy Checklist in the chat. Work through each section. Be specific—this becomes your playbook for the next year.

Key questions to answer:
- What does 'promotable' look like at your organization?
- Who decides your next opportunity?
- How can you authentically reach them?
- What wins should you be sharing?
- How often is enough without being too much?

You have 20 minutes. I'll play some focus music. If you finish early, pair up in the chat to share your plans."

## SLIDE 16: Performance Management Cycle
**Time: 4 minutes**

### Key Points:
Performance review is a year-long campaign, not an annual event.

Walk through each phase:
- Goal Setting → Align to promotion criteria from day one
- Throughout Cycle → Track wins in real-time
- Mid-Cycle Review → Request feedback check-in
- Self-Assessment → Write it like a promotion case
- Calibration Prep → Give your manager ammunition

### Script:
"Most people treat performance reviews like a test you cram for the night before. But the winners treat it like a year-long campaign.

At goal-setting, you should already be aligning your work to promotion criteria. Throughout the year, you're tracking wins. At mid-cycle, you're course-correcting. Your self-assessment reads like a promotion case. And before calibration, you're arming your manager with specific examples they can use to advocate for you."

---

## SLIDE 17: Maximize Your Check-Ins
**Time: 4-5 minutes**

### Key Points:
**The "Win + Ask" Formula:**
- WIN: "I completed X, which resulted in Y impact"
- ASK: "I'd like to take on Z to build toward [goal]"

### Power Questions:
1. "What would make me promotable in the next cycle?"
2. "Who else should know about this work?"
3. "Are there stretch opportunities I should pursue?"

### Script:
"Most people use check-ins for status updates. You're going to use them for strategic positioning.

Every check-in, lead with a win, then make an ask. This keeps you visible AND signals your ambition.

And these three questions? Memorize them. Use them. They change the dynamic of your manager relationship."

---

## SLIDE 18: Check-In Prep Template
**Time: 3 minutes**

### Facilitation:
"Never walk into a manager meeting unprepared again. Before every check-in, spend 5 minutes filling this out:

1. **Wins This Period** - 2-3 accomplishments with measurable impact
2. **Visibility Ask** - One opportunity or introduction to request
3. **Career Signal** - What you want to be known for
4. **Feedback Request** - A specific question for your manager
5. **Next Commitments** - What you'll deliver by next check-in

I'm sharing this template in the chat. Use it before your next 1:1."

---

## SLIDE 19: Your Sponsor Pipeline
**Time: 4 minutes**

### Key Points:
Three people who should consistently see your wins:
1. **Your Manager** - First line of advocacy
2. **Skip-Level Leader** - Your manager's manager
3. **Cross-Functional Leader** - Someone outside your team

### Script:
"You need three people actively aware of your wins:

Your **manager** is your first line of advocacy. Make sure they have evidence to fight for you.

Your **skip-level leader**—your manager's manager—has more influence than you think. They're often in rooms where decisions are made.

And a **cross-functional leader**—someone outside your immediate team who can speak to your impact across the organization.

This month's goal: Each of these three people should know at least one recent win of yours."

---

## SLIDE 20: 14-Day Visibility Sprint
**Time: 3 minutes**

### Key Points:
Three actions for the next two weeks:
1. Share one win this week
2. Schedule a strategic check-in
3. Add 5 wins to your tracker

### Script:
"Visibility is built through consistent action. Here's your sprint for the next 14 days:

**This week:** Share one win—email your manager or mention it in a team meeting. Just start the habit.

**Next week:** Schedule a check-in with your manager using the prep template we discussed.

**By the 14th day:** Add 5 wins to your tracker. Backfill from the past 60 days if needed.

Small, consistent actions. This is how visibility compounds."

---

## SLIDE 21: Quote Slide
**Time: 1 minute**

### Script:
"'You can't be considered for opportunities people don't know you want.'

Read that again. If you haven't explicitly told the right people what you want—not hinted, not hoped they'd figure it out—you're not in the running.

Your ambition is not obvious. You have to make it known."

---

## SLIDE 22: Summary - Key Takeaways
**Time: 2-3 minutes**

### Script:
"Let's recap the five key takeaways:

1. **Visibility is strategic, not accidental** - It requires a plan
2. **Track wins in real-time** - If you don't document it, it didn't happen
3. **Own your performance conversations** - Check-ins are visibility opportunities
4. **Know who needs to see your work** - Build your sponsor pipeline now
5. **Consistency beats one-time efforts** - Small actions compound over time

Which of these is your biggest shift in thinking?"

---

## SLIDE 23: Homework
**Time: 3 minutes**

### Key Points:
Before next session:
1. Complete your Visibility Strategy Checklist
2. Log 5 wins in your tracker
3. Share one accomplishment with a stakeholder
4. Use the Check-In Prep Template
5. Identify your 3 sponsor pipeline targets

### Script:
"This is your homework. Not optional—required if you want results.

I'm going to follow up in two weeks to check on your progress. Be ready to share one win you documented and one visibility action you took.

The work you do between our sessions is where the transformation happens."

---

## SLIDE 24: Closing Slide
**Time: 2 minutes**

### Closing Script:
"Get seen. Get promoted.

You have the skills. You have the results. Now you have the strategy to make sure the right people know it.

Your visibility strategy starts today—not tomorrow, not next quarter. Today.

Next month we're covering **Confident Career Pivot**—perfect timing as you start building this new visibility muscle.

Any final questions before we close?"
