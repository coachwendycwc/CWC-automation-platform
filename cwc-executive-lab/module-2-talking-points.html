    <h3>Complete Opening Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Welcome, welcome, welcome to Module 2 of the Executive Leadership Lab. I am so glad you're here, and I want to acknowledge something right from the start—you showed up. You carved out time in what I know is an incredibly busy schedule to invest in yourself and your career. That matters. That's leadership in action."</p>

        <p>"Before we dive in, I want you to take a moment wherever you are. Close your eyes for just a moment. Take a deep breath in... and release. You've been carrying a lot—the weight of your work, your ambitions, maybe some frustration about not being where you thought you'd be by now. I want you to set that down for the duration of this module. This is your time."</p>

        <p>"This month, we're tackling something that trips up so many talented women of color—and honestly, it's one of the most frustrating dynamics in our workplaces. Whether you're in corporate America, the nonprofit sector, or government agencies, the challenge is the same. It's the gap between doing excellent work and actually being recognized for that work. It's the space between delivering results and getting promoted for those results."</p>

        <p>"This session is called <strong>Strategic Positioning for Promotion</strong>. Now, I chose those words very intentionally. This isn't about working harder—you're already doing that. This isn't about being more qualified—many of you are overqualified. This is about being <em>strategic</em>. This is about <em>positioning</em>. This is about making sure that when promotion decisions are being made, your name is not just on the list—it's at the top of the list."</p>

        <p>"By the end of this module, you will have a concrete visibility plan, a system to track your wins, and the language to advocate for yourself in every conversation that matters. You'll walk away with tools you can use starting tomorrow morning."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="engagement-box">
        <strong>Reflection Prompt:</strong> "Before we go any further, I want you to think about where you are right now. On a scale of 1 to 10: How visible do you think your work is to the decision-makers in your organization? 1 means 'they have no idea who I am' and 10 means 'they know exactly what I contribute and value it.' Take a moment to write that number down—be honest with yourself. There's no judgment here."
        <br><br>
        <p>"If you're like most women I work with, you're probably somewhere in the 4-6 range. Maybe lower. Here's what I want you to know: wherever you are right now is your starting point, not your destination. By the end of this program, we're moving you up that scale."</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Slide 2: Welcome - Your Work Deserves Recognition</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">4-5 minutes</span>

    <h3>Complete Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Let me share some numbers with you, and I want you to really sit with these because they're not just statistics—they're our lived experience."</p>

        <p>"According to McKinsey and LeanIn.Org's Women in the Workplace research, <strong>for every 100 men promoted to manager, only 74 women of color receive that same promotion.</strong> And when we look at specific groups, the numbers are even more stark: <strong>only 65 Latinas and just 58 Black women</strong> are promoted for every 100 men. In 2024, Latinas faced their worst 'broken rung' yet—dropping from 76 the year before. Let that sink in."</p>

        <p>"Despite the fact that <strong>90% of Latinas say they want to be promoted</strong>—higher than any other group of women—they hold just 1% of C-suite roles. And <strong>only 46% of companies say they actively advance the careers of women of color.</strong> At the current pace, parity for women of color is almost 50 years away. That means if there are two equally qualified candidates—one who looks like us and one who doesn't—statistically, we're getting passed over. This isn't just a feeling. It's backed by a decade of research from over 280 companies and 10 million employees."</p>

        <p>"Now, I'm not sharing these numbers to discourage you. I'm sharing them because I need you to understand something critical: <strong>this is not about your performance.</strong> If you've been working harder, staying later, delivering more, and still not advancing—the problem is not your work ethic. The problem is not your competence. The problem is a visibility gap, and that's exactly what we're going to close in this module."</p>

        <p>"See, here's what nobody tells us: Excellence is expected. Excellence is the price of admission. But excellence alone does not get you promoted. I wish it did. I wish we lived in a world where the best work automatically got recognized and rewarded. But that's not the world we're operating in. In the real world, the people who get promoted are the people whose excellence is <em>visible</em> to the people who make decisions."</p>

        <p>"So in this module, we're going to stop hoping someone notices us. We're going to stop waiting for our manager to advocate for us. We're going to take control of our own visibility, our own narrative, and our own advancement. Sound good?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="engagement-box">
        <strong>Reflection Prompt:</strong> "I want you to think about this: Have you ever had that experience where you delivered exceptional work, maybe even saved a project or a client relationship, and then watched someone else get the credit or the recognition? If that's ever happened to you, you're not alone. This is a shared experience among the women I work with, and by the end of this module, we're going to make sure it stops happening."

    <h1 class="page-break">Slide 3: Objectives - What You'll Gain</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">3-4 minutes</span>

    <h3>Complete Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Let me tell you exactly what you're walking away with from this module. These aren't vague concepts or nice ideas—these are concrete deliverables that you will build as you work through this content."</p>

        <p>"<strong>First, you're going to create a Visibility Plan.</strong> This is your strategic playbook for making sure the right people know about your work. And when I say strategic, I mean it's tied directly to organizational outcomes and your organization's promotion criteria. This isn't about randomly sharing wins—it's about intentionally positioning yourself for advancement."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Second, you're going to build a Win-Tracking System.</strong> Think of this as your career receipts. When it's time for your performance review, when you're making a case for promotion, when you're updating your resume—you'll have documented evidence of everything you've accomplished. No more scrambling to remember what you did six months ago. No more understating your contributions because you forgot the details. You'll have it all captured."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Third, you're going to master Performance Conversations.</strong> This includes your regular check-ins with your manager, your performance reviews, and any conversation where your career trajectory is being discussed. Most people treat these as status updates. You're going to treat them as visibility opportunities. Every single one."</p>

        <p>"<strong>And fourth, you're going to identify your Sponsor Pipeline.</strong> These are the three to five people who need to be consistently aware of your work. Not just your manager—because your manager is only one voice in a room full of decision-makers. You need multiple people who can speak to your value when you're not in the room."</p>

        <p>"By the time you finish this module, you'll have all four of these mapped out. This is the foundation of your advancement strategy."</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Slide 4: The Challenge - Excellence Without Visibility</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">5-6 minutes</span>

    <h3>Complete Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"I want to introduce you to three archetypes. These are patterns I see over and over again with brilliant women of color who are stuck despite their talent. See if any of these sound familiar."</p>

        <p>"<strong>The first is The Silent Achiever.</strong> This is the woman who delivers exceptional results. Her projects come in on time, under budget, exceeding expectations. Her clients, constituents, or stakeholders love her. Her teammates rely on her. But here's the problem: no one outside her immediate team knows her name. She's a well-kept secret within her own organization."</p>

        <p>"The Silent Achiever was taught that good work speaks for itself. She was raised to be humble, to not brag, to let her results do the talking. And in theory, that sounds noble. But in practice? In practice, she's getting passed over for promotions that go to people who are less qualified but more visible. She's watching colleagues who do less get recognized more. And she's frustrated because she's doing everything right—except the one thing that matters for advancement."</p>

        <p>"<strong>The second archetype is The Untracked Wins.</strong> This is the woman who does great work but can't articulate it when it matters. When performance review time comes around, she's scrambling. 'What did I do in Q1? I know I did something important, but I can't remember the details.' Her self-assessment ends up generic and underwhelming—not because her work was generic, but because she didn't capture it in the moment."</p>

        <p>"Here's the reality: your manager has ten, fifteen, maybe twenty direct reports. They have their own deliverables, their own stress, their own career to manage. They cannot remember every good thing you've done over the past year. That's not their job. It's yours. If you don't track it, it's like it never happened."</p>

        <p>"<strong>The third archetype is The Missing Advocates.</strong> This is the woman who has a good relationship with her direct manager, but that's where her visibility ends. When promotion decisions are being made—and let me tell you how this actually works—there's usually a calibration meeting. A room full of leaders, discussing who should be promoted, who should get the high rating, who should get the bonus. Your manager is in that room, but so are six or seven other leaders."</p>

        <p>"If your manager is the only one who can speak to your value, you're at a disadvantage. Because when another leader says, 'I don't know her work,' or 'I've never heard of her,' your manager has to spend their political capital defending you instead of advocating for you. But if multiple leaders in that room can say, 'Oh yes, I know her work—she delivered that cross-functional project brilliantly,' suddenly you have momentum. You have multiple voices championing you."</p>

        <p>"Which of these three resonates with you? The Silent Achiever? The Untracked Wins? The Missing Advocates? Most of us are a combination of all three at different points in our career."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="engagement-box">
        <strong>Reflection Prompt:</strong> "Take a moment to think about which of these three archetypes describes where you are right now. Are you the Silent Achiever? Do you struggle with documenting your wins? Do you know you don't have enough people championing you? You might identify with more than one—and that's common. The good news is that these are all things we can address in this module. By the end, you'll have systems in place to close these gaps."

    <h1 class="page-break">Slide 5: Framework - The Visibility Equation</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">5-6 minutes</span>

    <h3>Complete Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Now let me give you the framework that's going to change how you think about advancement. I call it The Visibility Equation, and once you understand it, you'll never approach your career the same way again."</p>

        <p>"The equation is simple: <strong>Performance + Positioning + Promotion Criteria = Advancement.</strong>"</p>

        <p>"Let's break this down."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Performance</strong> is the work you do. It's the results you deliver, the projects you complete, the problems you solve. This is where most of us focus 100% of our energy. And listen—performance matters. You cannot be mediocre and expect to advance. But here's the truth that took me years to learn: performance is necessary but not sufficient. It's the table stakes. It's what gets you in the game, but it's not what wins the game."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Positioning</strong> is who knows about your performance and how they perceive you. This is visibility. This is reputation. This is the story that people tell about you when you're not in the room. You could be the highest performer in your entire organization, but if the people who make decisions don't know that—if they've never heard your name, never seen your work, never been told about your impact—then your performance doesn't count toward your advancement."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Promotion Criteria</strong> is what your organization actually rewards. Every organization has explicit and implicit criteria for who gets promoted. The explicit criteria might be documented—competencies, skills, behaviors at the next level. The implicit criteria are the unwritten rules—the types of projects that get noticed, the relationships that matter, the way successful people operate in your culture. If your excellent performance isn't aligned with what your organization values and rewards, you're running in the wrong race."</p>

        <p>"Here's where most high performers get stuck: they're doing amazing work—performance is high—but their positioning is weak and they're not aligned to promotion criteria. They're excelling at things that aren't being measured or valued for advancement."</p>

        <p>"Today, we're going to address all three parts of this equation. You're going to make sure your performance is being documented. You're going to build your positioning strategy. And you're going to align your work to what actually gets rewarded at your organization."</p>

    <div class="engagement-box">
        <strong>Reflection Prompt:</strong> "Pause the video for a moment and think about this: On a scale of 1-10, where would you rate yourself on each part of this equation? Performance—how strong is your actual work? Positioning—how well do decision-makers know your work? And Promotion Criteria—how well does your work align with what gets rewarded? Write down your scores."
        <br><br>
        <p>"If you're like most people, your performance score is high, but your positioning and criteria alignment scores are lower. That gap is exactly what we're going to close."</p>

    <h3>Complete Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Let's start with promotion criteria, because this is the foundation everything else builds on. Here's a question I want you to honestly answer in your own mind: Do you know—specifically and concretely—what your organization's documented promotion criteria are?"</p>

        <p>"I'm not asking if you have a vague sense. I'm asking if you could pull up a document right now that tells you exactly what competencies, skills, and behaviors are required for the next level. If you can't, you're not alone—but it's a problem we need to fix."</p>

        <p>"You cannot hit a target you cannot see. If you don't know what 'exceeds expectations' actually means at your organization, you're guessing. If you're not sure what leadership values beyond the generic 'be a team player' advice, you're shooting in the dark. And if your goals don't explicitly align with promotion criteria, you might be working incredibly hard on things that don't count toward advancement."</p>

        <p>"Here's what I want you to do this week—and I mean this week, not someday. Go find your organization's promotion criteria. It might be in your HR portal, your performance management system, or a competency framework document. If you can't find it, ask your HR business partner or your manager directly."</p>

        <p>"And when you ask your manager, use this exact language: <strong>'I want to make sure I'm positioning myself for promotion. Can you help me understand what "promotable" looks like in our organization? What are the specific criteria that are used when making promotion decisions?'</strong>"</p>

        <p>"Notice what this question does. It signals your ambition—you're telling them you want to be promoted. It asks for specificity—you're not accepting vague answers. And it positions you as someone who is strategic about their career, not just hoping to be noticed."</p>

        <p>"Once you have the criteria, I want you to do a gap analysis. Look at each criterion and honestly assess: Am I demonstrating this? Do I have evidence of this? Is this visible to decision-makers? Where are my gaps? That analysis becomes your development plan and your visibility strategy."</p>

        <p>"Now, here's the reality check: <strong>What if your organization doesn't have clearly documented promotion criteria? What if you ask your manager and they don't know?</strong> This happens more often than you'd think—especially in smaller organizations, nonprofits, government agencies, or any organization without mature HR systems. Don't let that stop you. Here's what you do instead:"</p>

        <p>"<strong>Strategy 1: Study who gets promoted.</strong> Look at the people who have been promoted in the last 1-2 years. What do they have in common? What projects did they lead? What skills do they demonstrate? What relationships do they have? The pattern of past promotions tells you what your organization actually values—even if it's not written down."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Strategy 2: Go above or around.</strong> If your manager doesn't know, ask HR directly. Ask your skip-level leader. Ask a senior leader you trust. Use this language: <em>'I'm committed to growing in this organization. I'd love your perspective on what distinguishes people who advance here. What do you look for when you're advocating for someone's promotion?'</em> Different leaders may give you different answers—and that's valuable data."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Strategy 3: Look at job postings for the next level.</strong> Pull up internal or external job descriptions for roles at the level you're targeting. What competencies do they list? What experience do they require? That's your unofficial promotion criteria."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Strategy 4: Create your own criteria and validate it.</strong> Based on your research, draft what you believe the promotion criteria should be. Then bring it to your manager or HR and say: <em>'I've been thinking about what it takes to advance here. I put together my understanding of what's required for the next level. Can you review this and tell me if I'm on the right track?'</em> This positions you as proactive and gives them something to react to—which is easier than asking them to create it from scratch."</p>

        <p>"The absence of formal criteria is not an excuse to stay stuck. It's an invitation to be resourceful. The women who advance are the ones who figure out the rules—even when no one hands them the rulebook."</p>

    <h1>Slide 7: Deep Dive - Strategic Visibility</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">5-6 minutes</span>

    <h3>Complete Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Strategic visibility is about being seen by the right people, at the right time, for the right work. Let me break down each of those components."</p>

        <p>"<strong>The right people</strong> means decision-makers. Not just your manager—though they matter—but the broader group of leaders who influence your advancement. This includes your skip-level leader (your manager's manager), cross-functional leaders who you work with or could work with, and anyone who has a seat at the table when promotions are discussed."</p>

        <p>"<strong>The right time</strong> means consistently, not just at performance review time. If you're invisible for eleven months and then suddenly start talking about your accomplishments in month twelve, that's not visibility—that's desperation, and people can sense the difference. Strategic visibility is a year-round practice."</p>

        <p>"<strong>The right work</strong> means the accomplishments that align with promotion criteria and organizational priorities. Not every win is created equal. Some wins are interesting but don't move the needle for your advancement. Other wins directly demonstrate that you're ready for the next level. You want to be visible for the work that positions you for promotion."</p>

        <p>"Now, let me share some signs that you might be invisible—and I want you to be really honest with yourself here."</p>

        <p>"Sign number one: Decision-makers don't know your name. If your skip-level leader doesn't know who you are, if cross-functional leaders couldn't pick you out of a lineup, you have a visibility problem."</p>

        <p>"Sign number two: You're not invited to strategic meetings. When the important conversations are happening, are you in the room? Or are you only hearing about decisions after they've been made?"</p>

        <p>"Sign number three: Your manager takes credit for your work—or at minimum, doesn't explicitly attribute it to you. When your manager presents team accomplishments to leadership, do they name you? Do they say, 'This was led by [your name]'? Or does it become 'my team did this' with no individual recognition?"</p>

        <p>"Sign number four: Opportunities go to less qualified peers. This is the most painful one. You watch someone with less experience, less skill, or weaker results get the opportunity you wanted. And often, the difference isn't merit—it's visibility. They were known. You weren't."</p>

        <p>"The breakthrough here isn't working harder. It's working smarter on your visibility. It's identifying who needs to see your work, finding authentic channels to reach them, sharing wins consistently, and volunteering for high-visibility projects."</p>

    <h1 class="page-break">Slide 8: Deep Dive - Win Documentation</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">4-5 minutes</span>

    <h3>Complete Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Here's a truth that might be uncomfortable: If you don't track it, it didn't happen. Not because your work didn't matter, but because you won't have the evidence when you need it."</p>

        <p>"Let me paint a picture. It's December. Performance review season. Your manager asks you to write your self-assessment. You sit down to write it, and suddenly your mind goes blank. 'What did I do this year? I know I was busy. I know I was stressed. But what were the actual accomplishments?'"</p>

        <p>"So you scramble. You dig through old emails trying to find projects. You look at your calendar trying to remember meetings. You end up with a self-assessment that's generic and underwhelming—phrases like 'supported the team' and 'contributed to projects' instead of specific, measurable impact statements."</p>

        <p>"And here's the worst part: your manager reads that self-assessment and thinks, 'Huh, I guess she didn't do that much this year.' Not because you didn't do amazing work—but because you couldn't remember it and articulate it compellingly."</p>

        <p>"Meanwhile, your colleague—who maybe did less than you—wrote a detailed self-assessment with specific metrics, named accomplishments, and clear impact. Guess who looks like the higher performer on paper?"</p>

        <p>"This is why win documentation is not optional. It's the foundation of everything else we're covering in this module. You need a system to capture your wins in real-time, while the details are fresh, while you remember the metrics, while you can articulate the impact."</p>

        <p>"I'm going to give you a framework later in this module that makes this easy. It takes five minutes a week. Five minutes. That's it. And those five minutes will transform your performance reviews, your promotion conversations, and your confidence in advocating for yourself."</p>

    <h3>Complete Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"I want you to read this quote with me: <em>'Visibility isn't bragging. It's ensuring your contributions are known by those who make decisions about your future.'</em>"</p>

        <p>"This is a mindset shift that many of us need to make. We've been conditioned—by our families, our cultures, our upbringing—to believe that self-promotion is arrogant. That talking about our accomplishments is unseemly. That humble people let their work speak for itself."</p>

        <p>"And there's beauty in humility. I'm not saying we should become obnoxious self-promoters who can't stop talking about ourselves. That's not what visibility is."</p>

        <p>"But here's the reframe I want you to sit with: Staying silent about your contributions is not humble. It's a disservice. It's a disservice to your career, obviously. But it's also a disservice to your organization, which needs to know who their high performers are. It's a disservice to other women of color who need role models and examples of what success looks like. And it's a disservice to your family and your future, because your advancement has ripple effects beyond just you."</p>

        <p>"When you share your wins strategically, you're not bragging. You're providing information that decision-makers need to make good decisions. You're helping your organization recognize talent. You're modeling behavior for others who are watching you."</p>

        <p>"So let's release the shame around visibility. It's not a character flaw. It's a professional responsibility."</p>

    <h1 class="page-break">Slide 10: Root Causes - Why Your Work Goes Unseen</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">5-6 minutes</span>

    <h3>Complete Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Before we get into solutions, I want to name the root causes of invisibility. Because if we don't understand why this happens, we can't fully address it."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Root cause number one: Modesty culture.</strong> Many of us were raised with messages like 'don't be boastful,' 'let your work speak for itself,' 'pride comes before a fall.' These messages were often delivered with good intentions, but they don't serve us in professional environments—whether corporate, nonprofit, or government—where visibility is currency. We internalized that talking about ourselves is inappropriate, and now we're suffering the consequences professionally."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Root cause number two: No tracking system.</strong> This is practical, not psychological. Without a system to capture wins as they happen, they disappear. You finish a project, you feel good for a day, you move on to the next fire, and three months later you can't remember the details. The win is lost—not because it didn't matter, but because you didn't capture it."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Root cause number three: Wrong audience.</strong> You might be visible to your immediate team. Your manager might know your work. But if the people who make promotion decisions don't know you, your visibility isn't reaching far enough. You're famous in the wrong room."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Root cause number four: Inconsistent communication.</strong> Some people only become visible at performance review time. They're silent for eleven months and then suddenly start trumpeting their accomplishments. This comes across as desperate and inauthentic. Effective visibility is consistent—regular, predictable, ongoing."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Root cause number five: Fear of being seen as 'too much.'</strong> Especially for women of color, there's a real fear of being perceived as aggressive, pushy, or self-aggrandizing. We've been told—sometimes explicitly, sometimes subtly—to not take up too much space. So we shrink. We downplay. We attribute our success to the team or to luck instead of owning our individual contribution."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Root cause number six: Waiting to be noticed.</strong> This is the most insidious one. Deep down, many of us believe that if we just work hard enough, someone will eventually see us and reward us. We're waiting for a fairy godmother manager to discover our brilliance and elevate us. But that's not how organizations work. The people who get promoted are the people who take ownership of their visibility—they don't wait to be discovered."</p>

        <p>"Which of these root causes resonates most for you? I want you to identify your primary barrier, because awareness is the first step to change."</p>

    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Alright, it's time for our first activity. We're going to do a Visibility Diagnostic—an honest assessment of where your visibility actually is right now."</p>

        <p>"I want you to pause this video and take about five minutes for this exercise. You'll need a piece of paper or a notes app. Here's what I want you to do:"</p>

        <p>"<strong>Part 1: Who Currently Knows Your Work?</strong> Make a list. Start with your manager—that's obvious. But then push further. Does your skip-level know your specific contributions? What about cross-functional leaders? What about senior leaders outside your direct reporting line? Be specific. Write actual names. By the time you're done, I want you to see exactly how far your visibility reaches—and more importantly, where it stops."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Part 2: Who Should Know Your Work?</strong> Now make a second list. These are the people who influence your advancement but aren't currently aware of your contributions. Maybe it's your manager's manager. Maybe it's the VP of another department. Maybe it's someone on the executive team. These are your visibility gaps—the spaces where you need to build presence."</p>

        <p>"Pause now and take five minutes to complete this exercise. Go deep on this. Be honest. Come back when you're done."</p>

        <p>"Welcome back. What I often hear from women who do this exercise is that they realize their visibility stops at their direct manager.

You need to build your own visibility with multiple stakeholders."</p>
        <br><br>

    <span class="time-badge">6-7 minutes</span>

    <h3>Complete Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Now let me give you the framework that makes win documentation simple and powerful. It's called <strong>What / So What / Now What</strong>, and every single win you capture should answer these three questions."</p>

        <p>"<strong>WHAT</strong> is the accomplishment itself. What did you do? Be specific about the deliverable, the project, the action you completed. Don't be vague here—'Supported the marketing campaign' tells me nothing. 'Led the email strategy for the Q3 product launch, including A/B testing and segmentation' tells me exactly what you did."</p>

        <p>"<strong>SO WHAT</strong> is the organizational impact. Why does this matter? This is where you quantify with metrics wherever possible. Revenue generated, costs saved, time reduced, problems solved, constituents served, efficiency improved, mission advanced. If you can put a number on it, put a number on it. If you can't, describe the qualitative impact—what changed as a result of your work?"</p>

        <p>"<strong>NOW WHAT</strong> is the connection to something larger. This win positions you for what? How does it connect to future goals, larger initiatives, or promotion criteria? This is where you show strategic thinking. You're not just completing tasks—you're driving toward something bigger."</p>

        <p>"Let me give you two examples to make this concrete."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Corporate example:</strong> 'WHAT: I led the Q1 product launch, managing a cross-functional team of 12 people across engineering, design, and marketing. SO WHAT: The launch generated $2 million in new revenue in the first 90 days and increased our customer base by 15%, exceeding our target by 40%. NOW WHAT: This positions our product line for the enterprise market expansion, which is a key strategic priority for the business this year—and demonstrates my readiness for a senior leadership role managing larger, more complex initiatives.'"</p>

        <p>"<strong>Non-profit example:</strong> 'WHAT: I redesigned our volunteer onboarding program, creating new training materials, a buddy system, and a 30-day check-in process. SO WHAT: This increased volunteer retention by 40% and reduced the time from application to active volunteering by two weeks. NOW WHAT: This enables us to scale our community outreach initiative ahead of schedule and positions me as someone who can design and implement programs that drive organizational impact.'"</p>

        <p>"<strong>Government example:</strong> 'WHAT: I led the implementation of a new case management system for our department, coordinating training for 45 staff members and managing the data migration from the legacy system. SO WHAT: This reduced case processing time by 30% and eliminated a backlog of 200 cases within the first quarter. NOW WHAT: This directly supports our agency's strategic goal of improving constituent services and demonstrates my ability to lead large-scale operational improvements—key competencies for a supervisory role.'"</p>

        <p>"Do you see how different this is from 'I worked on the product launch' or 'I helped with volunteer training' or 'I supported the system implementation'? The What/So What/Now What framework forces you to be specific, quantify impact, and connect to strategy."</p>

        <p>"Now it's your turn to practice this. You'll find the Win Tracking Template in the resources section of this module on Skool. Download it and make a copy for yourself."</p>

        <p>"Your task is to capture 3-5 wins from the past 30 days using the What / So What / Now What framework. Don't overthink this. The goal is to practice the framework and start building the muscle of win documentation."</p>

        <p>"A few tips as you work:"</p>

        <p>"First, wins don't have to be huge. Did you solve a problem? That's a win. Did you help a colleague? That's a win. Did you complete a project, even a small one? That's a win. We're looking for any contribution that had a positive impact."</p>

        <p>"Second, don't worry about making it perfect. This is a first draft. The important thing is to capture the information while it's fresh. You can polish the language later."</p>

        <p>"Third, push yourself on the 'So What.' This is where most people struggle. You know what you did, but you don't always know why it mattered. Ask yourself: What would have happened if I hadn't done this? What changed because I did? Who benefited? Those questions will help you find the impact."</p>

        <p>"Pause this video now and take about 12-15 minutes to complete this activity. Really dig into it. If you finish early, go back and add more detail to your entries. Come back when you're done."</p>

        <p>"And here's a pro tip: Set a recurring calendar reminder for Friday afternoons—just 5 minutes—to update your win log. Friday is perfect because you're already wrapping up the week, and the wins are still fresh. Five minutes a week is all it takes to build a year's worth of documented accomplishments."</p>

        <p>"Now that you have your wins documented, let's talk about how to strategically share them. This is the deep work portion of this module—you're going to build out your complete Visibility Strategy. You'll find the Visibility Strategy Checklist template in the resources section on Skool."</p>

        <p>"This checklist has six sections, and I'm going to walk you through each one with guiding questions. Be specific as you work through this—it becomes your playbook for the next year."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Step 1: Promotion Criteria.</strong> Document what your organization rewards. What does 'exceeds expectations' look like? What competencies are required for the next level? What behaviors are valued? If you don't know the answers, write down how you'll find out this week. This is your target—you can't hit what you can't see."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Step 2: Key Stakeholders.</strong> Identify 3-5 decision-makers who need to know your work. Beyond your manager, who has influence over your advancement? Who's in the room when promotion decisions are made? This always includes your skip-level leader and should include at least one cross-functional leader. Write down their names."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Step 3: Communication Channels.</strong> How will you reach each stakeholder? What's the most natural way to have legitimate visibility with them? With your manager, it might be your regular 1:1s. With your skip-level, it might be occasional project updates or asking to present at their team meeting. With cross-functional leaders, it might be collaborative projects or internal networking. Map out the channel for each person."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Step 4: Frequency.</strong> How often will you share wins with each stakeholder? What's sustainable? Don't overcommit—consistency matters more than intensity. Your manager might hear about wins weekly. Your skip-level might get a monthly update. Cross-functional leaders might hear from you quarterly or project-by-project. The key is being on their radar regularly, not just when you need something."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Step 5: Win Categories.</strong> Not all wins are equal for visibility purposes. What types of accomplishments should you be highlighting? Focus on wins that align with promotion criteria, demonstrate strategic impact, and are relevant to each stakeholder's priorities. Think about what matters most for advancement and tailor your message accordingly."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Step 6: Review Rhythm.</strong> When will you review and adjust this plan? Set a monthly check-in with yourself to assess your visibility. Are you reaching your target stakeholders? Are you sharing wins consistently? What's working? What needs adjustment? Put this review on your calendar now."</p>

        <p>"Pause this video and take about 20 minutes to work through all six sections. This is your most important deliverable from this module. Go deep. Be specific. Come back when you're done."</p>

    <h3>Complete Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Let's talk about something that most people get completely wrong: performance reviews. The way most people approach reviews is reactive. They wait until review season, scramble to remember what they did, write a rushed self-assessment, and hope for the best."</p>

        <p>"I want you to think about it differently. Your performance review is not an annual event—it's a year-long campaign. The outcome is determined by what you do in the months leading up to it, not what you do the week before."</p>

        <p>"Let me walk you through how to own each phase of the performance cycle."</p>

        <p>"<strong>At Goal Setting:</strong> This is where most people miss their first opportunity. When you set your goals for the year, you should explicitly align them to promotion criteria. Look at what's required for the next level, and make sure your goals give you opportunities to demonstrate those competencies. Don't just accept whatever goals your manager suggests—negotiate for goals that position you for advancement."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Throughout the Year:</strong> This is where your win tracking system comes in. You're not waiting until review time to document your accomplishments. You're capturing them in real-time, every week, using the What/So What/Now What framework. By review time, you'll have 50 weeks of documented wins to draw from."</p>

        <p>"<strong>At Mid-Year or Mid-Cycle Review:</strong> Many organizations have a formal Mid-Year review process—if yours does, treat it as a critical visibility opportunity, not just an administrative checkbox. Come prepared with documented wins, specific questions, and a clear ask for feedback. Use this moment to recalibrate expectations and ensure you're on track for the rating you want."</p>

        <p>"If your organization doesn't have a formal Mid-Year process, be proactive and request one yourself. Say to your manager: <em>'I'd like to schedule a mid-year check-in to discuss my progress toward my goals. I want to make sure I'm on track and get your feedback on what I could adjust for the second half of the year.'</em> This signals that you take your performance seriously and positions you as someone who owns their development. Ask specific questions: 'How am I tracking toward my goals? What would make the difference between 'meets expectations' and 'exceeds expectations'? Is there anything I should be doing differently?' Don't wait to be invited—create the opportunity yourself."</p>

        <p>"<strong>For Your Self-Assessment:</strong> This is your chance to make your case in writing. Don't be modest. Don't be generic. Write your self-assessment like it's a promotion packet. Lead with impact and metrics. Connect your accomplishments to organizational outcomes and promotion criteria. Make it easy for your manager to advocate for you."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Before Calibration:</strong> In most organizations, after managers write reviews, there's a calibration meeting where leaders discuss ratings across the team. Your manager will be in that room advocating for you—or not. Your job is to arm them with specific examples and talking points they can use. Send them a summary of your top accomplishments before calibration. Make their job easy."</p>

    <h1>Slide 16: Maximize Your Check-Ins</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">5-6 minutes</span>

    <h3>Complete Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Now let's talk about your regular check-ins with your manager. Most people use these meetings for status updates and problem-solving. That's fine, but it's a missed opportunity. Every check-in is a visibility opportunity."</p>

        <p>"I want to give you a formula that transforms your check-ins: <strong>Win + Ask</strong>."</p>

        <p>"The <strong>Win</strong> component: Open every check-in by sharing a recent accomplishment with impact. Not 'I've been busy this week.' You're making sure your manager hears about your wins regularly, not just when you remember to mention them."</p>

        <p>"The <strong>Ask</strong> component: Follow your win with a strategic ask. This could be asking for a growth opportunity, asking for visibility, or asking for feedback. You're signaling ambition and driving your own development."</p>

        <p>"Let me give you examples of what this sounds like in different sectors:"</p>

        <p>"<strong>Corporate example:</strong> <em>Win:</em> 'I completed the client analysis ahead of schedule, and it identified $500K in cost savings they hadn't seen before—they were thrilled.' <em>Ask:</em> 'Given the success of that analysis, I'd like to take on the Q3 strategic planning project to build more experience with executive presentations.'"</p>

        <p>"<strong>Nonprofit example:</strong> <em>Win:</em> 'The grant proposal I led was approved—we secured $150,000 in funding for the youth mentorship program, which will allow us to serve 200 additional families this year.' <em>Ask:</em> 'I'd love to take the lead on presenting our impact metrics to the board next quarter. It would give me more exposure to our leadership and help me develop my skills in executive communication.'"</p>

        <p>"<strong>Government example:</strong> <em>Win:</em> 'I streamlined the permit review process for our department, reducing turnaround time from 15 days to 7 days. We've already processed 40 additional applications this month as a result.' <em>Ask:</em> 'I'd like to be considered for the interagency task force on process improvement. It aligns with my career goals and would give me visibility with leadership across departments.'"</p>

        <p>"Now let me give you three power questions that you should weave into your check-ins throughout the year."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Question 1: 'What would make me promotable in the next cycle?'</strong> This is direct and powerful. You're asking for explicit criteria. The answer gives you a roadmap."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Question 2: 'Who else should know about this work?'</strong> When you share a win, ask this follow-up. You're enlisting your manager's help in expanding your visibility. Maybe they'll CC someone important on an email. Maybe they'll mention you in a leadership meeting. You're making it easy for them to amplify you."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Question 3: 'Are there stretch opportunities I should be pursuing?'</strong> This signals that you're ready for more. You're not waiting to be assigned—you're asking for challenges. It positions you as someone who is ambitious and growth-oriented."</p>

    <h3>Complete Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"I'm going to give you a tool that will transform how prepared you are for every manager conversation. It's called the Check-In Prep Template, and it takes just 5 minutes to complete before each meeting."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Section 1: Wins This Period.</strong> List 2-3 accomplishments with measurable impact since your last check-in. These become your conversation starters. You'll never again walk into a meeting without something concrete to share."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Section 2: Visibility Ask.</strong> Identify one opportunity or introduction you want to request. Maybe you want to present at a leadership meeting. Maybe you want to be introduced to a senior leader. Maybe you want to be considered for a high-visibility project. Write it down so you don't forget to ask."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Section 3: Career Signal.</strong> Clarify what you want to be known for. This keeps your long-term positioning in mind, even during tactical conversations. Are you trying to be seen as a strategic thinker? A people developer? A problem-solver? Make sure your check-in reinforces that brand."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Section 4: Feedback Request.</strong> Come with a specific question for your manager. Not 'How am I doing?' which invites a vague response. Instead: 'How did you feel about my handling of the client escalation last week? What would you have done differently?' Specific questions get useful answers."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Section 5: Next Commitments.</strong> Document what you'll deliver by the next check-in. This creates accountability and shows you're forward-thinking."</p>

        <p>"You'll find this template in the resources section on Skool. Use it before your next 1:1. I guarantee your manager will notice the difference in how prepared and strategic you are."</p>

    <h1>Slide 18: Your Sponsor Pipeline</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">5-6 minutes</span>

    <h3>Complete Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Let's talk about sponsors. Not mentors—sponsors. There's a critical difference."</p>

        <p>"A mentor gives you advice. They talk to you about your career. A sponsor gives you opportunities. They talk about you when you're not in the room. Sponsors put their reputation on the line to advocate for your advancement. They use their political capital on your behalf."</p>

        <p>"You need to build a sponsor pipeline—a set of leaders who are consistently aware of your work and willing to champion you. I recommend starting with three people."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Person 1: Your Direct Manager.</strong> This is your first line of advocacy. Your manager needs to have detailed, specific evidence of your accomplishments so they can fight for you in calibration meetings and promotion discussions. Don't assume they remember everything—keep them informed. Make it easy for them to advocate by giving them the talking points."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Person 2: Your Skip-Level Leader.</strong> This is your manager's manager. They have significantly more influence in promotion decisions than your direct manager alone. In many organizations, the skip-level has to approve promotions. If they don't know your work, your manager has to spend their political capital educating them—which is less effective than if the skip-level already knows you."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Person 3: A Cross-Functional Leader.</strong> This is someone outside your direct reporting line who can speak to your impact across the organization. When promotion discussions happen, having someone from a different function say 'I've worked with her and she's exceptional' carries enormous weight. It shows your value extends beyond your immediate team."</p>

        <p>"Your goal this month—and I want you to commit to this—is to make sure each of these three people knows at least one recent win of yours. That might mean sending your manager a quick summary. It might mean finding an opportunity to update your skip-level. It might mean scheduling a coffee chat with a cross-functional leader."</p>

        <p>"Three people. One win each. That's achievable, and it starts building your sponsor pipeline."</p>

    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Alright, we've covered a lot in this module. Now let's make it actionable with a 14-day sprint. These are three specific actions I want you to take in the next two weeks to start building visibility momentum."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Action 1: Share One Win This Week.</strong> Before Friday, I want you to share one accomplishment with your manager or your team. It could be an email, a mention in a team meeting, a quick update in your 1:1. The format doesn't matter—what matters is that you practice visibility. Break the habit of staying silent about your contributions."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Action 2: Schedule a Strategic Check-In.</strong> Book time with your manager for a career-focused conversation. Not a status update, not a project meeting—a conversation specifically about your growth and advancement. Come prepared with the Check-In Prep Template. Use the Win + Ask formula. Ask at least one of the power questions we discussed."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Action 3: Add 5 Wins to Your Tracker.</strong> You started your win log during this module. I want you to expand it with five more wins by day 14. Go back through the past 60 days and capture accomplishments you might have forgotten. The goal is to build the habit and have a solid foundation of documented wins to draw from."</p>

        <p>"These three actions are your minimum viable visibility practice. They're small enough to be achievable but significant enough to start creating change."</p>

        <p>"In two weeks, I encourage you to share your progress in the Skool community. Tell us: What win did you share? How did your strategic check-in go? How many wins are in your tracker? Sharing your progress creates accountability and inspires others."</p>

        <p>"I want to leave you with this: <em>'You can't be considered for opportunities people don't know you want.'</em>"</p>

        <p>"Read that again. Really let it sink in."</p>

        <p>"If you haven't explicitly told the right people what you want—not hinted at it, not hoped they'd figure it out, but clearly stated it—you are not in the running. Your ambition is not obvious. Your career aspirations are not self-evident. You have to make them known."</p>

        <p>"So many talented women of color wait. They wait for someone to notice their potential. They wait for their manager to offer an opportunity. They wait for the organization to recognize their readiness. And while they're waiting, they're watching other people—often less qualified people—get promoted because those people made their ambitions known."</p>

        <p>"I don't want you to wait anymore. I want you to declare. I want you to tell your manager what you want. I want you to position yourself explicitly for advancement. I want you to take ownership of your visibility."</p>

        <p>"The opportunity you've been hoping for? Someone has to know you want it. Start there."</p>

    <h3>Complete Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Let me recap the five key takeaways from this module. These are the messages I want you to carry with you."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Takeaway 1: Visibility is strategic, not accidental.</strong> Being seen by decision-makers doesn't happen by chance. It requires a plan. It requires intentionality. It requires consistency. You now have that plan—the Visibility Strategy you built in this module."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Takeaway 2: Track wins in real-time.</strong> If you don't document your accomplishments, they functionally didn't happen. You can't advocate for yourself with vague memories. You need specific, quantified evidence. Your win tracker is your career receipt book—maintain it religiously."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Takeaway 3: Own your performance conversations.</strong> Every check-in, every review, every conversation with your manager is a visibility opportunity. Stop treating them as administrative obligations. Start treating them as strategic career moments."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Takeaway 4: Know who needs to see your work.</strong> Your manager is necessary but not sufficient. You need multiple people who can speak to your value—your skip-level, cross-functional leaders, potential sponsors. Build that pipeline now, before you need it."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Takeaway 5: Consistency beats one-time efforts.</strong> Visibility isn't built in a day or during review season. It's built through small, regular actions over time. A monthly update to your skip-level. A weekly win shared with your manager. Quarterly touchpoints with cross-functional stakeholders. These small actions compound into career momentum."</p>

        <p>"Which of these five takeaways is the biggest shift in thinking for you? I encourage you to share it in the Skool community—I'd love to see what landed most powerfully for you."</p>

        <p>"Before the next module, you have five homework assignments. These are not optional—this is the work that turns this module's learning into real career change."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Assignment 1: Complete your Visibility Strategy Checklist.</strong> You started this in this module. Finish it. Make sure every section is filled out with specific, actionable details. This is your visibility playbook for the year."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Assignment 2: Log 5 wins in your tracker.</strong> Use the What/So What/Now What framework. Go back through recent months and capture accomplishments you might have missed. The goal is to build a robust foundation of documented wins."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Assignment 3: Share one accomplishment with a stakeholder.</strong> Not your manager—a stakeholder. This could be your skip-level, a cross-functional leader, or someone else in your sponsor pipeline. Practice the visibility you've been avoiding."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Assignment 4: Use the Check-In Prep Template.</strong> Prepare for and execute one strategic manager meeting. Come with wins to share, an ask to make, and questions to ask. Notice how different the conversation feels when you're prepared."</p>

        <p>"<strong>Assignment 5: Identify your 3 sponsor pipeline targets.</strong> Name your manager, your skip-level leader, and your cross-functional champion. These are the three people you'll be cultivating relationships with over the coming year."</p>

        <p>"Get seen. Get promoted."</p>

        <p>"Those four words are your mantra going forward. You have the skills. You've always had the skills. You have the results. You've been delivering results for years. What you have now—what you didn't have before this module—is a strategy. A system. A plan to make sure the right people know what you contribute."</p>

        <p>"I want to acknowledge something before we close. This work isn't always easy. Putting yourself out there, sharing your accomplishments, asking for what you want—it can feel vulnerable. It can feel uncomfortable, especially when we've been conditioned to stay quiet and hope someone notices."</p>

        <p>"But here's what I know: You are too talented to be invisible. You are too valuable to be overlooked. The organization you work for—and the world you want to impact—needs to know who you are and what you can do."</p>

        <p>"Your visibility strategy starts today. Not tomorrow. Not next quarter. Today. The first win you share, the first check-in you prepare for, the first stakeholder you connect with—those actions start today."</p>

        <p>"Next month, we're covering <strong>Confident Career Pivot</strong>—which is perfect timing as you start building this new visibility muscle. You'll learn how to navigate career transitions strategically and confidently."</p>
