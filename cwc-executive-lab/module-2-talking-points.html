    <h3>Opening Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Welcome to Module 2 of the Executive Leadership Lab. This month we're tackling something that trips up so many talented women of color—the gap between doing excellent work and actually being recognized for it.</p>
        <p>Today's session is called <strong>Strategic Positioning for Promotion</strong>, and by the end, you'll have a concrete visibility plan and the tools to make sure your work doesn't go unnoticed."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="engagement-box">
        <strong>Engagement:</strong> "Before we dive in, drop in the chat: On a scale of 1-10, how visible do you think your work is to decision-makers right now?"
    </div>

    <h1>Slide 2: Welcome - Your Work Deserves Recognition</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">2-3 minutes</span>

    <div class="key-points">
        <strong>Key Points:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Acknowledge their hard work and results</li>
            <li>The stats are stark: 58% of WOC feel overlooked, 2x less likely to be promoted</li>
            <li>Today we're going to change that narrative</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Look at these numbers. 58% of women of color report feeling overlooked for advancement. We're twice as likely to be passed over for promotion even when our performance is equal or better.</p>
        <p>This isn't about working harder—you're already doing that. This is about working smarter with your visibility. Today, we fix that gap."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="engagement-box">
        <strong>Engagement:</strong> "Raise your hand or put a '1' in chat if you've ever felt like your work went unnoticed while someone else got the credit."
    </div>

    <h1>Slide 3: Objectives - What You'll Gain</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">2 minutes</span>

    <div class="key-points">
        <strong>Walk through the four objectives:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Create a Visibility Plan</strong> - Strategic, tied to business outcomes</li>
            <li><strong>Build a Win-Tracking System</strong> - Your "receipts" for promotion conversations</li>
            <li><strong>Master Performance Conversations</strong> - Own check-ins and reviews</li>
            <li><strong>Identify Your Sponsor Pipeline</strong> - Know who needs to see your work</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"By the end of today, you'll walk away with four concrete deliverables. These aren't theoretical—you'll actually build these during our session together."</p>
    </div>

    <h1 class="page-break">Slide 4: The Challenge - Excellence Without Visibility</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">3 minutes</span>

    <div class="key-points">
        <strong>Three archetypes that keep us stuck:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Silent Achiever</strong> - Great work, no one knows</li>
            <li><strong>The Untracked Wins</strong> - Can't remember at review time</li>
            <li><strong>The Missing Advocates</strong> - No one fighting for you in the room</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Which of these sounds familiar? The Silent Achiever who delivers exceptional results but no one outside the immediate team knows their name? The one who can't remember their wins at review time? Or the one who realizes no one was advocating for them when the promotion decision was made?</p>
        <p>Good work doesn't speak for itself. Good work needs a microphone. And today, we're going to give you that microphone."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="engagement-box">
        <strong>Engagement:</strong> "In the chat, which of these three resonates most with where you are right now?"
    </div>

    <h1>Slide 5: Framework - The Visibility Equation</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">3-4 minutes</span>

    <div class="key-points">
        <strong>The Core Framework:</strong>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; margin: 16px 0; padding: 16px; background: #E8F4F6; border-radius: 8px;">
            <strong>Performance + Positioning + Promotion Criteria = Advancement</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Most high performers only focus on Performance. We need all three.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Here's the framework that changes everything. Advancement isn't just about what you do—it's about who knows what you do AND whether it aligns with what actually gets rewarded.</p>
        <p>Most of us have been focused entirely on performance. We thought if we just worked hard enough, someone would notice. But that's only one-third of the equation.</p>
        <p>Today we address all three parts."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="engagement-box">
        <strong>Pause Point:</strong> "Take a moment—which of these three areas do you think is your biggest gap right now? Performance documentation? Positioning? Or understanding your promotion criteria?"
    </div>

    <h1 class="page-break">Slide 6: Deep Dive - Know Your Promotion Criteria</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">4 minutes</span>

    <h3>Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Let's start with promotion criteria. You cannot hit a target you cannot see.</p>
        <p>How many of you actually know what your organization's documented promotion criteria are? Not what you assume they are—what's actually written down?</p>
        <p>If you don't know what 'exceeds expectations' means at your company, if you're guessing what leadership values, if your goals don't align with documented competencies—you're playing a game without knowing the rules.</p>
        <p>This week, I want you to find out. Ask your manager directly: 'What does promotable look like in the next cycle?' Get specific."</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Slide 7: Deep Dive - Strategic Visibility</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">4 minutes</span>

    <h3>Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Strategic visibility isn't about being loud or self-promotional in a way that feels inauthentic. It's about being intentional.</p>
        <p>Who makes promotion decisions at your organization? Is it just your manager, or is there a calibration committee? Who's in that room when your name comes up?</p>
        <p>If decision-makers don't know your name, if you're not invited to strategic conversations, if opportunities keep going to people who are less qualified but more visible—that's a visibility problem, not a performance problem."</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Slide 8: Deep Dive - Win Documentation</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">3 minutes</span>

    <h3>Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Here's a truth bomb: Your manager has too many direct reports and too much on their plate to remember every good thing you've done. That's not their fault—it's just reality.</p>
        <p>So when they go into that calibration meeting to advocate for your promotion, what evidence do they have? Only what you've given them.</p>
        <p>If you're scrambling to write self-assessments, if you're forgetting accomplishments from Q1 by Q4—you're leaving your advancement to chance. We're going to fix that today."</p>
    </div>

    <h1 class="page-break">Slide 9: Quote Slide</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">1 minute</span>

    <h3>Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"I want you to sit with this for a moment: <em>'Visibility isn't bragging. It's ensuring your contributions are known by those who make decisions about your future.'</em></p>
        <p>This is a reframe many of us need. We've been taught that self-promotion is arrogant. But staying silent about your contributions isn't humble—it's a disservice to your career and to the organization that needs to know who their high performers are."</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Slide 10: Root Causes - Why Your Work Goes Unseen</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">3-4 minutes</span>

    <div class="key-points">
        <strong>Six root causes:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Modesty culture</strong> - We were taught that talking about ourselves is inappropriate</li>
            <li><strong>No tracking system</strong> - Without a system, wins just disappear</li>
            <li><strong>Wrong audience</strong> - Your manager knows, but the people who make decisions don't</li>
            <li><strong>Inconsistent communication</strong> - You spike at review time but go silent the rest of the year</li>
            <li><strong>Fear of self-promotion</strong> - Worrying about being seen as 'too much'</li>
            <li><strong>Waiting to be noticed</strong> - Believing hard work will automatically be recognized</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="engagement-box">
        <strong>Engagement:</strong> "Which of these is your biggest barrier? Be honest with yourself."
    </div>

    <h1 class="page-break">Slide 11: Activity - Visibility Diagnostic</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">7-8 minutes</span>

    <h3>Facilitation</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>"Now we're going to do a quick diagnostic. I'm giving you 5 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Part 1:</strong> List everyone who currently knows about your work and impact. How far does your visibility actually reach?</p>
        <p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Now identify the decision-makers and stakeholders who SHOULD know your work but don't. These are your visibility gaps.</p>
        <p>I'll put you in breakout rooms of 3-4 people. Share what you discovered. You have 5 minutes—go!"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="engagement-box">
        <strong>Debrief:</strong> "What did you discover? Anyone willing to share a gap they identified?"
    </div>

    <h1>Slide 12: Framework - The Win-Tracking System</h1>
    <span class="time-badge">4-5 minutes</span>

    <div class="key-points">
        <strong>WHAT / SO WHAT / NOW WHAT Framework:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>WHAT</strong> - What did you accomplish? Be specific.</li>
            <li><strong>SO WHAT</strong> - What was the business impact? Metrics, revenue, time saved.</li>
            <li><strong>NOW WHAT</strong> - How does this connect to future goals or promotion criteria?</li>
